## Accomplishments
**Simple File Automation (SFA)**
I developed a product named Simple File Automation (SFA) at Amazon that allowed external business partners to independently upload and manage Amazon Air's (AIR DABI) fuel data from an FTP server. SFA was designed as a modular product, meaning that it can be reproduced for any use-case on the AIR DABI team with minimal customization. Before the introduction of SFA, AIR DABI engineers tasked with weekly on-call duties were regularly faced with debugging a legacy data pipeline that required them to converse back and forth with external business partners for debugging, deleting, upserting, and inserting records; this made training new-hires especially difficult. SFA empowered business partners to manage that data independently, and minimized stress and technical overhead for data engineers on AIR DABI.

**Credit Underwriting Model**
I developed, tested, and deployed a mixed model completely from scratch that generated prospective credit offers for customers using the LeafLink platform; it earned forty new credit customers in the first month of operation. Notably, this project was imagined and presented by me to the head of the credit team within LeafLink. Additionally, I also developed the data pipeline for running that model in production.
