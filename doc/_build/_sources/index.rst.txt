=====

Hello! Thank you for visiting my website.

If you are looking for quick links to my LinkedIn, PyPI, or GitHub profiles then head over to the right-hand side of the above navigation bar.

Professionally, I am a self-taught, ex-Amazon/Spotify/BuzzFeed Data Engineer located in New York City. I have eight years of experience working with big data overall, with four years of experience specifically as a Data Engineer. Before entering into Data Engineering, I was a Data Scientist. In terms of how I entered into big data, I taught myself Python, SQL, linear algebra, and machine learning after graduating from school. I relocated to New York City in December of 2017, and my first opportunity was at BuzzFeed as a Data Analytics and Measurement Analyst. Beginning in late 2019, I developed a fondness for back-end, big data engineering; that passion encouraged me to develop my software engineering skills in order to pursue data engineering opportunities. Beginning in early 2021, that goal was realized. 

Throughout my career, in addition to my daily responsibilites, I have focused on developing internal tools and products that, as I regularly say when asked, "makes the lives of engineers, non-technical colleagues, and customers easier". Specifically, the raison d'Ãªtre of those projects has been to automate or simplify laborious or complicated tasks or processes. Many times, those contributions turned into actual products. For a couple of high-impact examples of self-directed projects that were subsequently accepted and released as products, please refer to the products section of this site. 

In terms of what I am looking for in my career, I am principally interested in opportunities that allow me to continue to leverage my passion and experience as a back-end, big data engineer; that means developing, monitoring, and maintaining data pipelines, both scheduled and real-time, and big data infrastructure. Over the long term, I endeavor to become a Principal Data Engineer. In terms of location, I am partial to New York City; however, I am open to relocating to Seattle, San Francisco, and Richmond, VA, in no specific order of affinity.

Personally, I enjoy reading political theory and philosophy, modifying my 1997 Toyota Tacoma rock crawler, keeping up with Python updates, and spending quality time with friends and loved ones. I also enjoy cooking!
