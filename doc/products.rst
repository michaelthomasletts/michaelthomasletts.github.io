Products
========

The following products represent a couple of high-impact examples of self-directed projects from my career that were subsequently turned into products; however, this list is not exhaustive; there are other examples from my career as well. 

When I say that the following projects were "self-directed", I mean to say that these are projects that I independently imagined, designed, and tested during my free-time, without being asked to do so, and that I submitted for review by senior engineers and managers. The following products, I feel, are notable because they _demonstrate_ my passion, motivation, empathy, and ability to independently identify and resolve pain-points for customers and colleagues through careful listening and planning.
