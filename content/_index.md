Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Data Engineer living in NYC ðŸ—½ with about eight years of experience in big data. I currently work at Capital One but previously worked at Amazon, Spotify, and BuzzFeed, as well as a couple of start-ups. I also founded and maintain a few open-source Python packages, most notably 
[`boto3-refresh-session`](https://github.com/michaelthomasletts/boto3-refresh-session) which is used by various teams across universities, small companies, and FAANG companies.

When it comes to the cloud, I began my career working with GCP at BuzzFeed and Spotify, but I have spent the last several years working in AWS. 

Python and SQL are my primary languages, which I consider myself an expert at. I have used Apache Airflow at every company where I have worked, and Spark has also been a major part of my work, primarily in the context of AWS Glue but recently EMR as well. I have also worked with DBT, but primarily at LeafLink. 

I enjoy reading theory and philosophy, lifting weights, cooking, contributing to the open-source community, working on my 1997 Toyota Tacoma, and spending quality time with friends.
