Hello! 👋

I'm a Senior Data Engineer living in NYC 🗽 with about eight years of experience in big data. I currently work at Capital One but previously worked at Amazon, Spotify, and BuzzFeed, as well as a couple of start-ups. I founded and maintain [`boto3-refresh-session`](https://github.com/michaelthomasletts/boto3-refresh-session) which is an open-source project used by various teams across universities, small companies, and FAANG companies. I am actively developing an open-source CLI tool which I plan to release in Q2 2026 as well, and I have prior commitments to contribute soon to a burgeoning open-source project maintained by the Apache Software Foundation as well. 

When it comes to the cloud, I began my career working with GCP at BuzzFeed and Spotify, but I have spent the last several years working in AWS. 

Python and SQL are my primary languages, which I consider myself an expert at. I have used Apache Airflow at every company where I have worked, and Spark has also been a major part of my work. I have also worked with DBT, although primarily at LeafLink. Databricks and Delta Lake have also recently entered into my work over the last 1.5 years.

I enjoy reading theory and philosophy, lifting weights, cooking, contributing to the open-source community, working on my 1997 Toyota Tacoma, and spending quality time with friends.
