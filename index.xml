In fact, it has been outright dismissed by a minority of developers online; however, those detractors do not seem understand what set of problems <code>boto3-refresh-session</code> solves or <em>who</em> it is <em>for</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Just create profiles &ndash; it works for every single credential type and will refresh automatically. I don&rsquo;t know why you would create a library for this when all SDKs work the same with profile configurations.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a <em>very</em> common misunderstanding. While profiles cover many cases, they don’t solve every scenario Python developers encounter.</p>
<p>It is unclear if the origins of those spurious criticisms are rooted in basic misunderstanding or cursory trolling. Either way, I worry teams and individuals who would actually benefit from <code>boto3-refresh-session</code> will occasionally be deterred from evaluating it.</p>
<p>I am therefore compelled to clarify <em>who exactly this package is for</em> and <em>exactly what problems it does and does not solve</em>.</p>
<p>Arguably, it is not my responsibility to edify anyone about <code>credential_process</code>, etc; however, as the founder and core maintainer of <code>boto3-refresh-session</code>, it <em>is</em> my obligation to ensure the community understands, to the best of my ability, what this tool is and is <em>not</em>.</p>
<h2 id="some-examples-of-what-already-auto-refreshes-when-used-correctly"><em>Some</em> examples of what <em>already</em> auto-refreshes (when used correctly):</h2>
<p>The following bulletpoints are <em>not</em> an exhaustive list.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>EC2 instance roles (IMDS): Botocore’s EC2 provider fetches / rotates credentials from the instance metadata service automatically. No manual refresh needed in long-running apps if you let the default provider chain run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ECS / Fargate task roles (task metadata endpoint): Botocore’s ECS provider pulls / renews task role creds via the container credentials endpoint automatically. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>credential_process</code> (in <code>~/.aws/config</code>): if the external process returns JSON with an <code>Expiration</code>, <code>botocore</code> treats it as refreshable and will re-invoke before expiry. (If you hardcode creds or the process omits expiration, you lose true refresh semantics.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>AssumeRole</code> via <code>profile</code> (<code>role_arn</code> + <code>source_profile</code>): using a named profile (not hardcoded env vars) lets <code>botocore</code> renew the STS session behind the scenes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web identity (IRSA on EKS): the SDK exchanges the projected token and refreshes as needed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-examples-of-when-that-isnt-true-common-foot-guns-for-python-devs"><em>Some</em> examples of when that isn’t true (common foot-guns for <em>Python</em> devs):</h2>
<p>The following bulletpoints are also not an exhaustive list.<sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You bypass the provider chain. Example: exporting <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code> | <code>SECRET</code> | <code>SESSION_TOKEN</code> from a one-off <code>aws sts assume-role</code> and then launching a long process. Or sidestepping the standard credential provider in ECS. Those tokens expire and will not auto-refresh. That is where <code>RefreshableSession(method=&quot;custom&quot;)</code> becomes helpful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You pass explicit credentials to <code>boto3.Session(...)</code>. Providing keys directly (or reading them once from a file) fixes the credentials for the life of the process — no refresh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Profiles without expiration semantics. If your <code>credential_process</code> doesn’t emit <code>Expiration</code>, the SDK can’t plan a refresh (it treats them as static/opaque).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network / metadata blocked. Enterprises that block IMDSv2 or ECS task endpoints (or container lacks the env wiring) break auto-refresh even on EC2 / ECS (as mentioned above).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SSO &amp; very long runtimes. SSO profiles refresh while the device token is valid, but headless, weeks-long daemons can still hit interactive renewal walls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IoT credentials (X.509). The AWS IoT credentials provider (mTLS to the IoT endpoint, role alias, then STS creds) is not a built-in <code>botocore</code> provider. Out of the box, the SDK won’t auto-renew those for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>credential_process</code> binaries can be brittle, i.e. difficult to maintain and distribute.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="who-boto3-refresh-session-is-for-and-not">Who <code>boto3-refresh-session</code> is for (and not)</h2>
<p><code>boto3-refresh-session</code> is for <strong>Python developers</strong> who need a robust, <em>Python-native</em> way to handle expiring credentials — whether because they can’t rely on <code>credential_process</code>, they’re embedding <code>boto3</code> in long-running daemons, or they’re working with IoT / X.509 flows that the standard provider chain doesn’t support.</p>
<p><code>boto3-refresh-session</code> is <em>not</em> for people who use the standard ECS / EC2 credential provider, depend upon <code>credential_process</code> without friction, or are not aware of the limitations and edge cases associated with profiles, AWS credential providers, etc.</p>
<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>
<p><code>boto3-refresh-session</code> isn’t the easiest package to explain; it is a <em>niche</em> backend Python package. It doesn’t lend itself to a pithy, one-line slogan, which can make the README challenging to keep concise. In some ways, <code>boto3-refresh-session</code> is less about who it&rsquo;s for than not. Which is odd.</p>
<p>What reassures me is that the engineers and teams who found this project and adopted it tend to be highly competent, and so far the lack of open issues or pull requests suggests the library is stable and working as intended.</p>
<p>Still, I want to make this tool accessible to the very developers I originally had in mind when I published this project — namely, engineers and data scientists who struggle with expiring credentials in long-lived processes and don’t want to hand-roll refresh logic (or can&rsquo;t - for whatever reason). My hope is this post clarifies common misconceptions about what this project is and is not, and why it exists.</p>
<p>If you’re a Python developer working with long-running workloads, IoT / X.509 flows, or any environment where the standard provider chain falls short, <code>boto3-refresh-session</code> exists so you can stop worrying about credentials and focus on your application.</p>

Unlike regex, which (<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/rebar?tab=readme-ov-file#dictionary">depending on the implementation</a>) may scale exponentially with input size, Aho-Corasick scales linearly. That property — linear time complexity — makes it <em>ridiculously fast</em>, and ideal for large-scale data remediation.</p>
<p>I first learned about Aho-Corasick back in 2018 but filed it away under “interesting but unnecessary for me right now.” Years later, I found myself responsible for remediating records across datasets at petabyte scale.</p>
<p>At the time, remediations were being performed using SQL queries embedded with regular expressions, running against an already-overloaded relational database. The approach was inefficient: <em>most</em> client datasets took between 30 minutes to an hour to process, and in some cases stretched as long as <em>55 hours</em>. As you can probably imagine, those datasets with excessive runtimes were enormous.</p>
<p>Recognizing an opportunity to improve things, I began re-architecting the remediation code. Given the scale of the data and the need for runtime and memory efficiency, it quickly became clear that the shared RDBMS was a major bottleneck. Profiling revealed that regular expressions — not just SQL overhead and database performance — were the primary cause of long runtimes. As the number and length of substrings grew, performance degraded exponentially. This also proved true when using Python’s built-in <code>re</code> module.</p>
<p>In modern data engineering, large datasets are often processed using distributed systems like Apache Spark, with custom user-defined functions to apply transformation logic. Another common tool is DuckDB, which also supports UDFs and is popular for fast local analytics and ease of use.</p>
<p>However, DuckDB began leaking memory at scale — confirming concerns <a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-node/issues/55">previously raised by the community</a>. And while Spark offered better scale, efficiently sharing a large Aho-Corasick automaton between executors introduced more complexity than it solved. User-defined functions also tend to be inefficient.</p>
<p>To avoid shared-memory challenges in Spark and instability in DuckDB, I opted to use Python’s built-in <code>multiprocessing</code> library in tandem with Aho-Corasick.</p>
<p>Since Python multiprocessing typically involves deep memory copying between processes, which would have blown up RAM usage at scale, I used the <code>fork</code> start method on Linux to ensure memory sharing via copy-on-write semantics. This allowed large, immutable data structures (like the target dataset and automatons) to be reused across processes without duplication, keeping memory usage comfy.</p>
<p>Additionally, I took care to scope all shared data within a global cache, which avoids passing large payloads via <code>Pool.apply_async(...)</code> calls and minimizes serialization overhead.</p>
<p>The results were staggering: <strong>55 hours → 7 seconds</strong>.</p>
<p>A key reason for this performance wasn’t simply the use of Aho-Corasick but <em>how the data was shared</em>. By loading large datasets and compiled automatons once, and forking worker processes afterward, I avoided memory duplication entirely. If I had passed these structures via arguments or used <code>spawn</code>, it would have resulted in prohibitive memory usage and slower compute due to unnecessary serialization and GC pressure.</p>
<h2 id="important-concepts">Important Concepts</h2>
<p>Before you rush to implement Aho-Corasick expecting miracles, a word of caution: <strong>Aho-Corasick + parallelization won’t yield superb performance unless your code is optimized.</strong></p>
<p>To borrow from the pseudo-code further below, you’ll need to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>The difference between “spawn” and “fork” memory allocation modes in Python’s multiprocessing module and how fork enables memory-efficient parallelism via copy-on-write. This matters because using spawn (the default on macOS and Windows) will fully copy large objects, causing massive memory spikes if you’re not careful. On Linux, fork allows those objects to be shared so long as they’re never mutated.</li>
<li>The importance of the <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html">“tidy data” principle</a> and general data layout — so your data can be scanned efficiently.</li>
<li>The necessity of <strong>profiling</strong> your code, early and often.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, realize you may not need to use the <code>multiprocessing</code> library after all. You might be able to write a user-defined function that’s implemented in DuckDB or Spark. That decision depends primarily on the scale of your data<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and-or comfort with digging deep into Spark. To be honest, I actually <em>recommend</em> that you use a user-defined function in DuckDB — that is, if the scale of your data isn’t enormous. It will be less efficient than using Aho-Corasick + <code>multiprocessing</code> but certainly simpler.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-aho-corasick-with-python">How to Use Aho-Corasick with Python</h2>
<p>The pseudo-code that follows accepts two pandas <code>DataFrame</code> objects: <code>target</code> and <code>sensitive_values</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>target</code> contains the data that must be scanned for sensitive content and remediated
sensitive_values contains the values to search for and obfuscate</li>
<li>The Aho-Corasick automaton does not care how sensitive values appear in target—whether as substrings or exact matches. All matches are remediated the same way.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>&quot;1234&quot;</code> is a sensitive value, then <code>&quot;1234_5678&quot;</code> becomes <code>&quot;xXxX_5678&quot;</code></li>
<li>If <code>&quot;1234&quot;</code> appears on its own, it becomes <code>&quot;xXxX&quot;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Multiple matches per record are handled without issue. Referring back to the tidy data concept: <code>sensitive_values</code> is represented in a long format.</p>
<p>To illustrate:</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>]</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Why does this matter? Because this long format allows the data to be grouped by <code>element_name</code>, deduplicated, and quickly loaded into per-column automatons. Each parallel process then scans each record in each column for matches in its associated automaton.</p>
<p>Lastly, you’ll need to download <a href="pyahocorasick"><code>pyahocorasick</code></a> and <code>pandas</code>. You can use <code>polars</code> instead of <code>pandas</code> if you prefer. <code>polars</code> may actually make the following pseudo-code even faster, albeit marginally. There are also Rust-based implementations available out there online.</p>

<p>If you want a tool that makes memory and runtime profiling incredibly easy then check out <a href="https://github.com/michaelthomasletts/profile-this">this repository I wrote</a>. Sometimes, line-by-line profiling is too granular; rather, you need to understand how your code performs, from a memory allocation perspective, <em>temporally</em>. I wrote this repository for those situations exactly — but with an emphasis on simplicity and speed.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
